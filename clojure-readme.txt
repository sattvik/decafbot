Clojure for Android(tm)
=======================

Building
--------

In order to build Clojure with Android support, you will most likely need to
copy the included 'local.properties.example' file to 'local.properties' and
edit the following properties:

  android.enabled  Must be set to 'true' to enable Android support.

  android.version  The version of the Android SDK with which to build.  This
                   should be a number.  The minimum supported version is 7.

  android.sdk.dir  The root directory of your Android SDK installation.

You may optionally define the property 'proguard.jar' and set it to the
location of ProGuard's 'proguard.jar'.  This will enable the use of
ProGuard to perform a better minification of the bundled dx.jar, resulting in
a smaller Clojure jar file.


New Jar files
-------------

When Android support is enabled, Ant will build a couple extra files of
interest to Android developers:

clojure-nosrc.jar:
  Just like 'clojure.jar', but without source files.

clojure-dex.jar:
  A version of 'clojure-nosrc.jar' with all classes compiled into a Dalvik
  executable.  This file may be used with one of Android's class loaders.
